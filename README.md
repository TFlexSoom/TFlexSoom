## A Bit About Me
I've been coding since I was 11. I really enjoy wide variety of different topics and interests in computer science. I work as a Software Engineer, provoking discussion over broad technical design and finding new ways to code the monotonous. I've orchestrated billed subscriptions, gift-card rewards, experiment roll-out, unit testing, request rate-limiting, and Peer-to-Peer transactions through use of different technology stacks and languages.
