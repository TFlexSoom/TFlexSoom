## A Bit About Me
I've been coding since I was 11. I really enjoy wide variety of different topics and interests in computer science. I work as a Software Engineer, provoking discussion over broad technical design and finding new ways to code the monotonous. I've orchestrated billed subscriptions, gift-card rewards, experiment roll-out, unit testing, request rate-limiting, and Peer-to-Peer transactions through use of different technology stacks and languages.

### Cool Code Snippits I Often Reuse
- [Async Generator for SQL based database sessions for FastAPI dependencies](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68970830/7799798) [Gist](https://gist.github.com/TFlexSoom/c6335044e9a726e2ce5597e3c96ff316)
- [Godot Behavior Abstraction](https://gist.github.com/TFlexSoom/498946d58871a7de4f42b8938508f4f5)
- [Go Tree Datastructure](https://github.com/TFlexSoom/go-tree/blob/main/lib/tree.go)

### Projects During My Spare Time
- Shrunk and Found: A Third Person Sandbox Adventure Game Made With Godot
- Gasm: An assembler written in Golang for crossplatform/crossarchitecture builds

### Hobbies
- I play [Magic The Gathering](https://moxfield.com/users/TFlexSoom)
- I listen to [Dark Techno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ3D8EaEtdI)
